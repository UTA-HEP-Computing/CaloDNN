How to run BDT analysis

There are several options you can change in the script before running:

    basePath is the folder that samples or sample subfolders are in.

    samplePath is a list pointing to the samples to be used for each class.

    target_names are the class names.

    classPdgID are the class pdgIDs.

    All features in the input samples are automatically found and added to the
        analysis, but you can mark the features which you donâ€™t want to be in the BDT
        by altering the badKeys list.

BDT.py takes a number of inputs:

    python BDT.py <output_folder> <max_depth> <n_estimators> <learning_rate>

All plots, learning curves, and feature rankings should be saved to the
specified output directory.
